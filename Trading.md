## Trading Process

The investment decision-making process of Pump.aiâ€™s AI agent is as follows:

1. **Monitoring**:
   The AI agent continuously monitors textual messages on X (formerly Twitter) related to a predefined set of assets. It filters out noise and identifies trending assets.
2. **Research**:
   Leveraging large language models (LLMs), the AI agent autonomously gathers information about the identified tokens and conducts investment research.
3. **Decision-Making**:
   Based on the research findings, the AI agent automatically adjusts the weightings of assets within the portfolio and executes rebalancing trades on trusted decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Hyperliquid.
