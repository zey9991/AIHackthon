## **What is Hyperliquid's Vault?**

Hyperliquid's Vaults are on-chain strategy pools that allow users to provide liquidity for various trading strategies, which can be automated or managed by designated vault leaders. These vaults are integral to Hyperliquid's Layer 1 infrastructure, enabling strategies such as market making and liquidations to operate seamlessly within the decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem. For example, the Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) vault engages in activities like market making and liquidations, ensuring that the community can share in profits typically reserved for elite players on traditional platforms.

Importantly, **vault leaders are required to maintain at least 5% of the vault at all times.** This ensures they have "skin in the game" and aligns their interests with those of other participants. Leaders cannot withdraw funds from their vault if doing so would reduce their share below the 5% threshold, acting as a safeguard against malicious behavior.

## **Why Integrate Hyperliquid's Vault?**

Integrating Hyperliquid's Vault brings significant advantages:

- **Democratized Participation**:
   Community members can contribute liquidity to AI-driven investment strategies, sharing in the profits and fostering an inclusive investment ecosystem.
- **Advanced Infrastructure**:
   Hyperliquid's Vaults leverage Layer 1 technology to provide high-performance execution for complex strategies, ensuring efficient and transparent operations.
- **Enhanced Security**:
   On-chain vaults provide a secure mechanism for storing assets, reducing risks associated with hacking or unauthorized withdrawals.
- **Integrity and Accountability**:
   The mandatory 5% minimum stake for vault leaders ensures they are financially committed to the success of the strategy, effectively discouraging harmful behavior. This requirement aligns the incentives of leaders and participants, creating trust within the ecosystem.

By integrating Hyperliquidâ€™s Vault functionality, **Pump.ai** aims to build a robust, decentralized, and trustworthy platform that empowers participants while leveraging the principles of decentralized finance (DeFi).
